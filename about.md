## Biography

My name is Jackson Passey and I absolutely love all things research. When I get into a new project, I get very excited, already diving into the data to see what stories are being told, try out new models and visuals, and portray to collaborators what we can learn. I especially enjoy data about people, deciphering their experiences and lifestyles, confirming or debunking stereotypes, and making sense of nonsensical behvaior. I aim to attain a career that allows me to apply the same passion and desire to study cultural and behavioral trends through data analytics and artificial intelligence. 

My family grew up in Laguna Hills, CA and moved to Gilbert, AZ just before starting high school. My two parents raise my brother with severe autism, who has also been a major motivation for me to succeed in academics and technical skills for a future career. After high school, I served a two year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Bismarck, ND, and afterwards enrolling into BYU to major in statistics and minor in mathematics. During my time at BYU, I developed skills in inference, modeling predictions, mathematics, data visualization, feature engineering, and programming softwares like R, Python, SQL, SAS, and Excel. I also was able to work internships and student-level jobs in professor-advised research, Provo Missionary Training Center, and Swire Coca-Cola. 

As of now, I am enrolled in BYU's MS Statistics program with the graduation date set to April 2026. I look foward to furthering my education in statistics and getting exposed to new and more difficult projects. 

## Timeline

#### 2015-2019 

I went to Campo Verde High School located in Gilbert, AZ. I spent a lot of my time in high school devoted to sports, namely football and soccer. My original passion and goal used to be to be a scholarship football kicker and punter for D1 school like BYU, but by the time I entered senior year, I realized I had a much better chance getting into BYU with academics rather than sports. I was ranked as a D2 kicker (4.0 stars) on a [professional kickers/punters rankings list](https://www.chrissailerkicking.com/player-rankings/?year=2019), but my grades, ACT score, and other extracurriculars (mathlete, soccer, and a regular volunteer for the local Special Olympics groups) projected me for greater education.

While I have only a little regret for my decision to not pursue collegiate sports, I believe excelling in academics would have been much more difficult for me. That doesn't mean I still like to talk about it! Below is a picture of me kicking a 51-yard field goal to set a high school record for longest field goal.

What was absolutely crucial for my introduction to statistics was my AP Statistics class. Because of my move to California, the high school-level math classes from my junior high school time, which was supposed to count for high school credit, did not count because of the move. Therefore, I had to take four years of higher level math classes. I took AP Calculus AB and BC my sophomore and junior years, and then AP Statistics my senior year. I hated calculus, but *loved* statistics. To see how statistics applied to so much of the world, like sports, research, business, and virtually any topic, I fell in love immediately. I decided after completing the math course I would study statistics as my major at BYU.

I then decided to serve a mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. To those unfamiliar with an LDS mission, young men (and women) sacrifice two years (1.5 years) after graduating from high school to teach about their faith to those interested. They can be sent almost anywhere in the world. 

I learned a lot about how to be an understanding leader, which admittedly was something I struggled to be at first. I learned how to help my peers in multiple ways, whether that was demonstrating how to succeed in finding people to teach, setting plans to achieve goals, or even to be emotionally supportive in times of need. One of the most memorable experiences was that at the end of my mission, my mission president asked me to travel around the entire mission for my last six weeks and instruct other missionaries the tips and tricks I learned to achieve success during my two-year mission. It was a tremendous experience being able to help those missionaries invigorate and inspire them to work hard before I ended my mission.

Now as a new statistics student at BYU, I was dedicated to working hard in my new program and preparing myself as much as I can to have an impressive graduate school application. I knew before I even began my first class I wanted to pursue a masters degree, and so I wanted to position myself to finding out what experiences I need to get there. 

My first statistics contact was the data science club president at BYU. He offered to work with students in the club to help build their resume and attain internships. I figured he would have great advice. The first thing he did was heavily critique my resume. All I had on my resume was bullet points from my mission and a grocery store job from high school, along with the occasional award. He helped reshape my resume and then suggested I work with a professor as soon as possible to get into research. Working as a research assistant will be much more crucial for technical development than classes. I thanked him and then directed my next objective to get into research.

My second point of contact, and the one I have had for years, was my first BYU Statistics Professor, Dr. William Christensen. He taught a class that introduced concepts like ANOVA, data wrangling, power analysis, and pairwise comparisons. He also taught the generals statistics class. I did a preliminary scan on the topics he has interest in researching, and noticed he has experience and written publications in environmental sciences, psychology, nutrition, and anatomy -- topics I find intriguing in as well. I asked him what it takes to be a research assistant for him, and he recommended I work as a teaching assistnat first. 

After working as his TA for a semester, I applied and was offered the job to work as his newest research assistant. This was a dream-come true for me: this is my first step into applying statistics work and getting paid to do so! My first project involved assisting another RA to model knee movement in a device for the BYU engineering department. My second paper
