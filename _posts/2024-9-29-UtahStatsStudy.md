title: "UtahStats Dating Survey Report"
description: I partnered with the Instagram account UtahStats to learn about dating culture in Provo/Orem. Here I share what I learned from the data regarding young adult lifestyle, college, dating, relationships, and other interesting topics, and how the analysis turned into my first ever marketable product.

## Introduction
Last year, I deleted Instagram completely. I was wanting to make a change from my lifestyle where I wasted hours and hours on reels each day. Later in November, however, my family urged me to redownload it and start a fresh profile, looking for more meaningful accounts to follow. That was when I stumbled upon the Instagram profile [@UtahStats](https://www.instagram.com/utahstats/). With my love of data analytics in the realm of human behavior, psychology, and culture, this profile became a major source of excitement. I would tell my friends to follow this account purely because of how interesting their insights were, and where I think my stats background could help improve the reporting. As I approached the summer of 2024 and an enrollment in a Statistcs masters program at BYU, I wanted to explore more statistical psychology. I reached out to the account owner, Jacob Dunn, purely on a whim, asking if he had a project he would want to collaborate on, or at least have me contribute to. After a couple of discussions, we landed on an idea for a data analytics project with an unpredictable outcome: a summary of his first ever survey.   

As a psychology student at BYU, Jacob Dunn had a desire to explore niche facts about college students living in Utah. He learned how statistics can be utilized to study various populations. He created the first "ProvoStats" survey (as it was named then) to collect data, originally passing out fliers to invite students to take the survey and contribute their experiences. Once enough data was collected, Jacob posted unique findings on Instagram. Overtime, the page grew tremendously. As he kept posting more of his findings, Instagram followers demanded more answers to questions about young adult culture. This led to Jacob further enrichening his range of topics by creating multiple surveys with more specialized questions. This opened opportunities for followers from outside Utah County to respond to surveys and contribute to the data, hence creating the brand [@UtahStats](https://www.instagram.com/utahstats/).

Participants of the @UtahStats surveys are presented with a broad range of questions, and their responses are recorded and processed using Qualtrics. These questions range from topics such as previous relationships, dating, church and college activity, politics, and other topics unique to the Utah County area.  

## Synopsis

With a sample of 2,101 respondents (and 1,881 had usable data). From our quick exploration of the data and the **table 1** below, we understood some of the main characterstics of our sample:
- While the range of our sample covers ages between 18 and 30, **75% are below 23 years of age.**
- 75% of survey respondents attend BYU and 14% attend UVU. **This emphasizes a geographical response bias towards BYU/Provo young adults being more regular participants than Orem/UVU.** 
- 96% of survey respondents are of the LDS faith.
- 57% of survey respondents served missions (and 54% of missionaries served in foreign missions).

The next couple sections discuss some of my personal favorites from the paper as they both present some very intersting findings and gave me the opportunity to tap into statistical and technical skills.

### Ineference on Monthly Dates and Car Ownership

> In this figure, we see the effect of car ownership on the number of dates per month. What is astonishing is how different gender and age reacts to car ownership and dating. Apparently, females in this sample under 21 go on significantly more dates when they own a vehicle than females that do not own one (p = 0.004). Males 21 and older who own a car go on significantly more dates than those without a car (p = 1.1e-5).

There are a couple of aspects from this analysis I wish to highlight. First of all, I believe this figure teaches a very interesting and convincing story about males 21+. To say and determine that men 21+ in Provo/Orem and whether they own cars is tied to how many dates they can go on in a month can be a fascinating narrative to share in an entertaining research paper. It has viewer shock value, and it is not an impossible situation. 

However, the results differ when considering different statistical testing scenarios. There were two tests to consider calculating both intervals and p-values: one was a standard t-test for means among filtered these groups, and the other is t-pairwise comparisons (with a Bonferonni p-value adjustment). The latter, which is not as commonly known among general populations, is considered a more robust approach as it evaluates all group combinations simutaneously while adjusting for Type-I error (i.e. false positives). The t-test can only compare two groups at a time and provides only one p-value and one interval; this ultimately decreases the likelihood of procuring a Type-II error (false negative). 

I was left with a difficult decision: if I am interested in reporting potential differences among groups, do I care about reporting false negatives or a false positives? In other scenarios, it depends on the context. For example, if a patient goes in for a cancer screening, a false negative is much more consequential than a false positive, because we would rather administer treatment to someone who does not need care than fail to administer treatment to someone who does. Ultimately, no decision I would be making with this paper would have drastic consequences such as a failed cancer detection test, so I decided to inflate my likelihood of a Type I error (false positive) and utilized two-group t-distribution calculations for this part of the inference. 

I only reported testing from the t-test analysis, but I wanted to also see how each the other test compared. As stated already, the p-value for a t-test comparing monthly dates for 21+ year-old males who do and do not own cars was 1.1e-5, which would be considered significant among most decided alpha values. When computing pairwise t-testing, however, the p-value was 0.124 (or 0.044 without adjustment) for the specific subset comparing 21+ year-old males. 

Ultimately, there are certainly much better ways to analyze this problem than the one I performed. But this part of the inference, particularly the decision-making on what exactly I report, taught me a lot about how versatile statistical reporting can be, as well as, unfortunately, how easily things can be interpreted one way or another. This is one of those unique cases where statistics becomes more of an art than a science.   

### Monte Carlo Simulation on Femaleâ€™s Minimum Height for Male Partner 
![f7.3](/assets/UtahStats/figure7.3.png)

```
# Monte Carlo Simulation: potential height differences and preferences between males and females # 
n <- 50000 # number of couples to make

sample_female <- female_data[sample(x = 1:nrow(female_data), size = n, replace = T),]
sample_male <- sample(x = male_data$height, size = n, replace = T)
height_differences <- sample_male - sample_female$height
height_requirements <- sample_male - sample_female$height_requirement

# Monte Carlo Insights #
mean(height_differences < 0)
sd(sample_diffs < 0) / sqrt(n)
# 7% of women may find a randomly assigned male partner at least an inch shorter than her
# MC Error: 0.1%

mean(sample_reqs < 0)
sd(sample_reqs < 0) / sqrt(n)
# 20% of women will not find a randomly assigned man that meets their height requirements 
# MC Error: 0.2%
```

## Conclusion

I learned a lot about how to report statistical inference with a lot of complications in statistical reasoning in mind, namely survey response biases, imbalanced groups, and reporting findings under the pretense of a generally non-academic audience and doing so **with statistical cautions** in place. I also experienced how to tell a compelling story using visualizations and tables, and explaining to readers what data visualizations can teach them about Utah culture.
