## Introduction
Last year, I deleted Instagram completely. I was wanting to make a change from my lifestyle where I wasted hours and hours on reels each day. Later in November, however, my family urged me to redownload it and start a fresh profile, looking for more meaningful accounts to follow. That was when I stumbled upon the Instagram profile [@UtahStats](https://www.instagram.com/utahstats/). With my love of data analytics in the realm of human behavior, psychology, and culture, this profile became a major source of excitement. I would tell my friends to follow this account purely because of how interesting their insights were, and where I think my stats background could help improve the reporting. As I approached the summer of 2024 and an enrollment in a Statistcs masters program at BYU, I wanted to explore more statistical psychology. I reached out to the account owner, Jacob Dunn, purely on a whim, asking if he had a project he would want to collaborate on, or at least have me contribute to. After a couple of discussions, we landed on an idea for a data analytics project with an unpredictable outcome: a summary of his first ever survey.   

As a psychology student at BYU, Jacob Dunn had a desire to explore niche facts about college students living in Utah. He learned how statistics can be utilized to study various populations. He created the first "ProvoStats" survey (as it was named then) to collect data, originally passing out fliers to invite students to take the survey and contribute their experiences. Once enough data was collected, Jacob posted unique findings on Instagram. Overtime, the page grew tremendously. As he kept posting more of his findings, Instagram followers demanded more answers to questions about young adult culture. This led to Jacob further enrichening his range of topics by creating multiple surveys with more specialized questions. This opened opportunities for followers from outside Utah County to respond to surveys and contribute to the data, hence creating the brand [@UtahStats](https://www.instagram.com/utahstats/).

Participants of the @UtahStats surveys are presented with a broad range of questions, and their responses are recorded and processed using Qualtrics. These questions range from topics such as previous relationships, dating, church and college activity, politics, and other topics unique to the Utah County area.

## Conclusion

I learned a lot about how to report statistical inference with a lot of complications in statistical reasoning in mind, namely survey response biases, imbalanced groups, and reporting findings under the pretense of a generally non-academic audience and doing so **with statistical cautions** in place. I also experienced how to tell a compelling story using visualizations and tables, and explaining to readers what data visualizations can teach them about Utah culture.
