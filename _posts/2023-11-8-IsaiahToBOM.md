## Introduction

The Holy Bible is one of the most revered and consistently read texts in the entire world. The complexities of biblical histories, from religious themes and worship, languages, and to major societal events, fascinate scholars today. However, what is commonly overlooked is the connections between the Bible and the Book of Mormon. In the beginning of the Book of Mormon, the record opens with a family commanded by God to leave their home in Jerusalem, escape the incoming Babylonian Exile, and start a new civilization in the modern-day Americas. One of the belongings of this family was a record written on brass plates, in which the biblical prophets and narratives from the five books of Moses and the records of the Jews up and to the prophet Jeremiah. One of the most commonly referenced prophets made by Book of Mormon characters is Isaiah, in which his words, themes, and doctrines are mentioned 780 times (according to LDS scholars).

The words of Isaiah are some the most revered (and confusing) that Book of Mormon writers regularly recite. However, modern scholars have stated that the authorship of the book of Isaiah is not solely written by the prophet: arguments have circulated stating that Isaiah's disciples had written the second half of the book, and Isaiah himself had no contribution. This claim is valid since the second half of the book was written after the Babylonian Exile from 597 to 538 BCE, over a hundred years after Isaiah had passed on. The Book of Mormon family left Jerusalem in 600 BCE. This leads to the following question: how could Book of Mormon civilizations have the entire account of Isaiah in the brass plates if the latter half of the Book of Isaiah wasn't written after 538 BCE? 

The aim of this post isn't necessarily to resolve this concern, but to visualize it using detailed cross referenced data scraped from ().
