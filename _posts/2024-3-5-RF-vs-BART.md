description: Random Forests and Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) are both powerful, nonparametric tree-based ensemble methods that predict on both regression and classification tasks. In this post and repository, I explore how they compare with each other regarding model fit, tuning parameters, computation time, and accuracy.
